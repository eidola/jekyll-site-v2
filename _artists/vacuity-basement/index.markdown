Vacuity Basement founded Eidola Records and released *Somewhere I Have Never Travelled / Information* (E002CA) a 90 minute cassette featuring live and 'studio' records. After an period of gigs between 1999-2001 they stopped performing but have continued to record albeit sporadically - and although nothing has been released in almost 15 years bar material bootlegged by Joseph Martin - earlier this year the above track was released quietly on Soundcloud.
