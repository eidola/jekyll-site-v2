Bristol based rapper/beat maker Ratface is as much influenced by his old school punk and lo-fi roots, by the squat and free party scene that birthed his early sound and by Bristols dub/reggae bass and soundsystem culture as he is by more traditional hip hop leanings. He has a unique and fresh take on UK hip hop and lyrically you can find him at the opposite end of the spectrum from the more cliched, bling bling side of commercial US rap. Dipping more into social an political observation, personal reflection and storytelling, underpinned by the everyday struggles of a working man.

Ratface has played prolifically all over the Uk for the last 5 years, but due to family commitments and a heavier focus on recording new material, now only plays one off/ select shows.

Ratface released a slew of short LP’s on the local Bumtapes imprint. ‘Ratface on ice’, ‘Down with Ratface’ and ‘Enough Ratface’ were all free party staples and expanded on a high energy punk rap hybrid sound. 2011’s ‘Gold tones: Ratface please!’ mixtape marked a move towards a more sample heavy boom bap sound. 2012/13 saw Ratface back away from the live scene and his old sound, going back to the lab an collaborating with a number of different producers to create something new and different. Currently in the pipeline is the ‘Ratface Forever’ EP/Mini LP for London label GM sounds, produced by Spider J (Dubwiser/Lee Perry/Roots Manuva/kano/Screwfizzer). Plus a full length collab with the UK hub of the Clear Air Turbulence collective provisionally called ‘fuck it state of mind’ and coming out soon here on Eidola records is a collaboration with long time friend and Berlin based hip hop producer Skeptical beats, entitled ‘Super alley gospel’.
