#About#
Eidola Records formed in the late 1990s around the band *Vacuity Basement* to release principly avant-grade, noise, experimental and proto free folk genres and sub-genres and so on. The label was eventually wound up as the people involved disipated and other things took priority. But after years of idle threats we're back.

#Joseph Martin/Joey Chainsaw/Black and White Progressions#
Our first release - *The Sylvia Beech EP* (as y... records) - featured not only several contributions from Joe but each of the 20 limited edition jiffy bag editions featured a different photograph supplied by Joe. The second release and first Eidola Release proper *E1CA* featured Joe on at least one track if not more. The artwork for the 3rd was Joe's and so on and so on. Even though we didn't release much of Joe's solo output or, having wound the label up, any of his later output he was a huge presence in the formation of Eidola Records. Others have assembled his recorded output at the [Joey Chainsaw Archive](https://joeychainsawarchive.bandcamp.com/) included most if not all of his Eidola Records output.
