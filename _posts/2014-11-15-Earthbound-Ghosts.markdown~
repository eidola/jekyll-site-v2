[Sean James King's](/artists/sean-james-king) *Earthbound Ghosts* was intended as the companion piece to *Lo-fi Disco Blues* with a remixed version produced by Autotistic as the b-side however it was never released either the original nor remixed version. Now 10 years on and foreshadowing a forth coming collaboration between Autotistic and Sean James King the Autotistic remix of *Earthbound Ghosts* is finally available as a stream.
